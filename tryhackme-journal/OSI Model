# OSI Model â€“ Layered Architecture of Network Communication

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data moves through a network. It consists of 7 layers:

1. **Physical** â€“ Transmits raw bits over a physical medium.  
   _Example: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, hubs._

2. **Data Link** â€“ Ensures node-to-node data transfer and handles MAC addresses.  
   _Example: Switches, MAC Address._

3. **Network** â€“ Routes data between networks using IP addresses.  
   _Example: Routers, IP._

4. **Transport** â€“ Ensures reliable transmission with protocols like TCP/UDP.  
   _Example: TCP handshake, UDP streaming._

5. **Session** â€“ Manages sessions between applications.  
   _Example: API session handling._

6. **Presentation** â€“ Formats or encrypts data.  
   _Example: SSL/TLS, encoding, compression._

7. **Application** â€“ Closest to the user; handles high-level protocols.  
   _Example: HTTP, DNS, FTP._
